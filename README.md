2. Dimensional Reduction Algorithms
4. Distributed Programming
5. Cloud Architecture Design

Favorite programming languages:
1. C/C++
2. Python
3. Javascript
4. Ruby (on Rails)

Other technologies:
1. OpenMP, OpenMPI, CUDA.
2. Pytorch, Tensorflow, FastAPI, Django, OpenCV.
3. React.js, Next.js, Typescript.
4. GraphQL, MongoDB.

Currently learning:
1. AWS Cloud Native Framework: Lambda, DynamoDB, API Gateway, AppSync, Step Functions, SQS, SNS, etc.
2. Embedding Systems: MicroPython


I am currently working on personal projects, but I am open to any kind of collaboration.
