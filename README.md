### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

-I studied computer science Guanajuato, Mexico.

-My favorite Computer Science topics are computer vision, natural language processing, dimension reduction algorithms, data visualization, and distributed programming.

-My favorite programming language is C ++ but I also like it and I do well in Python, currently the one I use the most is Javascript.

-Iâ€™m currently learning cloud deployment and app development tools including React.js, React Native, serverless functions, Docker, Hasura's GraphQL engine and FastApi. My goal is to learn to develop Machine Learning applications and deploy them quickly in the cloud.

-I am currently working on personal projects.
